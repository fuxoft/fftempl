If you are not already familiar with Lua language and/or if you don't run your own HTTP server on your own machine, it's highly unlikely you'll find FFTempl useful in any way.","","About FFTempl","FFTempl allows you to have (almost) absolute freedom in mixing dynamic and static content using various templates and scripts, without need for any database. You only need Lua 5.1 installed (available as package in Ubuntu and Debian) and a sensible webserver that allows for CGI execution and URL rewriting. The core FFTempl system is (like Lua itself) extremely simple but allows you to expand its possibilities almost limitlessly.","","FFTempl was tested using Apache 2 on Linux, I have no idea if and how it works under different servers / OSes (it probably won't without some tweaking because it uses the command os.getenv('QUERY_STRING') to get the URL parameters from Apache).","","I made FFTempl to satisfy my needs which are probably different from what you need. If you find it useful, great. If you don't, please use one of many other dynamic content systems that are freely available. It's probably meaningless to ask me to \"implement this or that\" in FFTempl because you can implement almost everything yourself, using hooks, without changing the core system. But I am open to suggestions.","","What FFTempl allows you to do","Your whole HTML site is stored as static files in any directory structure you deem necessary (as if you used normal static webpages). Required scripts and template files for FFTempl are all stored in a single directory called YourWebsiteRoot/fftempl/.","","The most important principle of FFTempl operation is as follows: FFTempl is only concerned with files that have \".htm\" extension and leaves all other files alone. That means you can have .php or .html (yes, \".html\" is something different than \".htm\") or .gif or .swf files on your website and FFTempl does not care about them at all - how they are handled depends on your webserver configuration only and has nothing to do with FFTempl.","","FFTempl springs into action every time a file with \".htm\" extension is requested. If someone requests file called /dir1/dir2/page.htm from your webserver, this request is redirected to FFTempl, which loads this file from disk (this is not a HTML file but \"FFTempl source file\", explained later), parses it and returns the result to the webbrowser which asked for it. \"Parsing the file\" means that template, tags and/or scripts are applied to the file. You can do almost anything, including incorporating the results of arbitrary OS commands into your pages. Thanks to templates and tags, it's very easy to make different parts of your website available in different designs and layouts, each of which only has to be defined once to immediately propagate the changes to whole site. To a casual visitor, your website looks like it consists only of static HTM pages (unless you want it to look like dynamically generated website).","","Once more: The directory structure is entirely up to you (except for the required /fftempl directory). The only rule is that if something has to be dynamic or use templates, it has to have the \".htm\" extension. Other files are not altered by FFTempl in any way. Note that all your normal webserver configuration is still in effect for all files.","","What FFTempl does not allow you to do","If you are excited after reading the previous paragraphs, please curb your enthusiasm. You must understand what FFTempl is not:","","FFTempl does not provide any means for \"live\" editing of your online pages. How you create your files and how you transfer them to your webserver is entirely up to you (personally, I have the whole website structure on my home PC, edit it using texteditor and then transfer the changes online using rsync).","","FFTempl does not incorporate WYSIWYG in any shape or form. You have to understand HTML/CSS if your want to create your own webdesigns and you have to understand Lua if you want to create your own scripts. All the content is defined using text files. You don't have to understand Apache or change its configuration after you successfully installed FFTempl.","","FFTempl does not \"hold you by the hand\". With great power comes great responsibility. There is nothing in FFTempl that prevents you from creating megabytes of useless output or scripts that consume 100% of your CPU or erase your important files. You have been warned.","","Which leads us to the next point:","","Security","FFTempl is not very \"secure\", although this needs longer explanation: I think FFTempl is very secure in the sense that person who visits your website cannot use FFTempl to gain unauthorized access to your system or to see files outside of your public HTML directory. On the other hand, it's not very difficult, under the default FFTempl configuration, for knowledgeable person to see your FFTempl source, template and tag files, your FFTempl scripts etc... FFTempl may be made more \"obscured\" by choosing hard-to-guess filenames for these files but this is not something I needed or wanted.","","Finally, it's really bad idea to use FFTempl on webservers whose \"public HTML\" directories are accessible by multiple people who don't entirely trust each other. FFTempl files basically empower anyone capable of uploads to his public HTML directory to do anything he could do if he had full shell access with \"www-data\" rights! Including, but not limited to, changing contents of other people's public HTML directories. Again, this security aspect could be improved, but this is not a scenario I care about and it would limit the possibilities of FFTempl. Note that you (as the server admin) can install FFTempl for your own web directories and you can have other (\"untrustworthy\") people to have their web directories on the same machine - and they

page FFTempl generates is created from on its source file, template file and tag file.","","Source files contain the actual dynamic content of the page. For example the text you are reading right now. Source files have the \".htm\" extension and can be located anywhere on your website (even inside the \"fftempl\" directory!). Source files can also contain page-specific Lua scripts which are to be executed.","","Template files define the basic rules of transforming the source files into something that almost resembles HTML. They use the \".tpl\" extension and are located inside the \"fftempl\" directory. The template files usually define the pages' colors, fonts and other common elements like header and footer (but can also define anything else). Many different source files can use the same template file and there can be any number of different template files, each for different part of your site.","","Tag files define your own (pseudo)HTML tags. Basically, it defines which sequences of characters should be replaced by other sequences of characters or by results of running your custom scripts. For example, you can define your own HTML tag called \"{crazy_divider}\" which will be replaced by \"","","<center>","- o - o - o - o - o -","</center>","\" each time it appears in your source or template file. Tag files use the \".tag\" extension and are all stored in the \"fftempl\" directory. As with template files, many different source files can use the same tag file and there can be any number of different tag files for different parts of your site.","You must understand the paragraphs above to be able to use FFTempl. Now, experiment a little bit with the links that are included at the bottom of all pages on my website. They allow you to see source, template and tag files of every page on fuxoft.cz. Try clicking on some of them, then come back here.","","How it Works","OK, done with looking? You now probably have some basic idea how FFTempl works so we can have a detailed look:","","If any document ending with \".htm\" is requested, FFTempl loads the source file (of the same name) from the disk (again: The \".htm\" files don't contain HTML code bude \"pseudocode\" which is used to generate the HTML the websurfer sees). The source consists of any number of parameters and each parameter begins with line containing its name, enclosed in double parentheses.","","For example, if you look at the source file of this page (click \"this source\" at the very bottom of that page), you can see it consists of two parameters, whose names are \"TITLE\" and \"BODY\" (TITLE is 1 line long, \"BODY\" has many lines).","","Parameters beginning with the underscore (_TEMPLATE, _EXTRATAGS, _CODE etc...) have special meaning for FFTempl. Other parameters can have any names you desire. It's true that \"TITLE\" and \"BODY\" can remind you of similarly named HTML tags but they could be called for example \"XYZZY\" and \"FROTZ\" - it's entirely up to you how you name your parameters (except the predefined names beginning with underscores)!","","Some parameters can appear more than once in the source file. These are called \"multiparameters\" and will be explained later.","","As a next step, FFTempl loads the relevant template file. The template file is usually \"fftempl/default.tpl\" but this can be overriden by including parameter called _TEMPLATE in the source file.","","The template files look almost like a HTML page. What FFTempl does now is that it takes the template and replaces all occurences of string \"((paramname))\" with the contents of parameter called paramname (from the original \".htm\" source file). If the template file contains parameter which does not exist in the source file, it's silently discarded from the result.","","We now have something that resembles HTML page (let's call it \"intermediate page\") but we are not done yet.","","Now we load the relevant tag file from the disk. As was the case with the template file, tag file can be defined by parameter named _TAGS but if it's not present, \"default.tag\" file is used.","","The tag file consists of lines which have the following format:","","tag := replacement","","FFTempl now looks for all instances of each tag in the intermediate page and replaces each of them with the relevant replacement. Note that both tag and replacement can be anything at all and they don't have to be enclosed in parentheses. I used parentheses because they are easily accessed even when I am using the Czech keyboard. If you are working on U.S. keyboard you should probably use some less common delimiters like \"\" or \"{}\"... Or you don't have to use the delimiters at all and write something like StartOfBoldText, if you are bold. The choice is yours.","","If the tag contains a dollar sign (\"$\"), this dollar sign matches any string in the intermediate file. If replacement also contains dollar signs, all of them are appropriately replaced by the string that was originally used in the intermediate file. I know it sounds confusing but it's really simple. For example, let's assume your tag file contains the following line, defining the {mailto} tag:","","{mailto $} := <a href=\"mailto:$\">$</a>","Then, if you include the following text anywhere in your source file (or template - it doesn't matter because it appears in the intermediate file in both cases):","","My e-mail is {mailto satan@hell.sk}, write to me!","it gets automatically expanded to:","","My e-mail is <a href=\"mailto:satan@hell.sk\">satan@hell.sk</a>, write to me!","Note that the lines in \".tag\" file are interpreted and replaced one by one, from top to bottom, and this order is very significant because it can be used for nested tags!","","Maybe you also noticed that some lines in the .tag file contain \":=!\" instead of \":=\". In these cases, the right string is not replacement string but the name of the Lua function which is invoked to get the value used for replacement (this is advanced stuff and you need to understand Lua to use it).","","Now think for a little while about the possibilities all of this gives to you. However, there is lots more that FFTempl can do for you!","","Advanced Usage","If you want to create dynamic content like, for example, on this page, that shows my current age in days, you need to learn Lua. The reasons I rewrote FFTempl from Ruby to Lua were Lua's great speed, small footprint and the fact that Lua scripts are easily \"hackable\" and modifiable during the runtine which is very useful in FFTempl. (The page mentioned above also shows you the usage of special predefined source file parameters _EXTRATAGS and _CODE which allow you to easily embed ANY dynamic content into any FFTempl page.)","","After you learn Lua (which is really very simple and elegant language), just look at the main two FFTempl files: \"parser.cgi\" and \"fftempl.lua\". They contain all the functionality of FFTempl in just a few kilobytes of Lua code and you can see what other mechanisms FFTempl allows. For example, what exactly happens if someone requests non-existent .htm page.","","Also note the \"custom.lua\" file which gets automatically included during each FFTempl invocation and contains FFTempl modifications which should apply to all .htm pages on your site. The included \"custom.lua\" file is used on fuxoft.cz to create simple methods which you used to view the contents of source, template and tag files. Yes - this functionality is not hard-coded and you don't have to use the \"custom.lua\" file if you don't want to (you can modify it as you see fit or you can simply delete it).","","Multiparameters","\"Multiparameter\" is a term for parameter that appears more than once in the source file. For example, the source file could contain the following (apart from other parameters):","","((POST))","10/11/1957: I was born","((POST))","7/5/1979: I was run over by train","(and it hurt).","((POST))","2/9/1999: I died.","This is a multiparameter consisting of three items. Now, whenever \"((POST))\" appears in the template file, it will be replaced by all items of the relevant multiparameter. But there is one further nuance to make your life easier. Let's have an example. Let's say that your template file contains the following lines:","","Here is my diary:","{p}ENTRY: {b}((POST)){/b}{/p}","{p}End of my diary.","Let's assume that your tag file defines {p} and {b} as some sort of \"bold\" and \"new paragraph\" tags. The trick is that FFTempl doesn't just blindly insert all three values one after another but duplicates the whole template line containing the \"((POST))\" string required number of times! Thus, the result will be:","","Here is my diary:","{p}ENTRY: {b}10/11/1957: I was born{/b}{/p}","{p}ENTRY: {b}7/5/1979: I was run over by train","(and it hurt).{/b}{/p}","{p}ENTRY: {b}2/9/1999: I died.{/b}{/p}","{p}End of my diary.","Another thing to note is that if your template file contains reference to parameter which is not included in the source file at all, FFTemplate acts as if it was multiparameter with zero items, which - as shown above - is something slighty different from \"empty string\". In this case, the above example template would result in:","","Here is my diary:","{p}End of my diary.","Notice there is not a single occurence of \"ENTRY:\", which is probably exactly what you wanted.","","CODE and EXTRATAGS special parameters","Parameter ((_CODE)) allows you to include any Lua code which will be exectued when the page is parsed. It's normally used to define functions that will be used for generating special dynamic content on the page. The relevant tags for these functions have to be defined in the tag file using the \":=!\" operator.","","However, if you use some function just on a single page on your website, it's counter-productive to reference this function in the global tag file (and force FFTempl to seach for it on each page). That's where the ((_EXTRATAGS)) parameter comes in handy. During the parsing, all contents of this parameter are added at the beginning of the current tag file (of course, they are not actually added to the \".tag\" file, FFTempl just \"thinks\" they are there). This allows you to use custom functions to generate not only HTML but also \"pseudocode\" which can be automatically further expanded using standard tag mechanisms. Note than when tag replacing takes place, it doesn't matter if tag is found in a section of page that originated from the source file or from the template file! It's replaced in any case.","","However, CODE parameter can also be used for setting and changing hooks (explained in detail inside the \"custom.lua\" file) and doing whatever crazy stuff you can think of.","","Double dash parameter masking","This scary name hides rather simple feature (added in January 2007). Whenever the web client asks fftempl for a page which is named foo--bar.htm (contains double dash), this name is automagically and transparently changed to foo.htm?_dash_argument=bar. What use is this? The easiest way to explain is to look at this example. You see dozens of links on that page, which seem to point to dozens of different static pages, each of which contains a comic strip. In fact, all strips are displayed using the same page, which is called \"strip.htm\". For example, the URL /redmeat/strip--zoo.jpg.htm is automatically expanded to /redmeat/strip.htm?_dash_argument=zoo.jpg. The \"strip.htm\" page just looks at what's in the variable args._dash_argument and displays the indicated image file.","","(By the way, the \"args\" Lua table always contains all GET arguments of the current HTTP request available for your perusal.)","","Are you still asking what's this good for? It allows your parametrized dynamic pages to look as if they were static pages. That means they can be better indexed by search engines, for example, or mirrored by download programs.","","Note that the part before the (first) \"--\" is non-greedy, i.e. the URL /foo--bar--baz.htm gets replaced by /foo.htm?_dash_argument=bar--baz. Also note that you probably encounter horrible problems if your site contains any .htm files whose name contains \"--\" (that was the reason why I chose this rather unusual combination).","","Persistence and speed","This is probably the right time to stress that FFTempl has no status persistence at all. In contrast with mod_php or mod_ruby, everything is invoked from scratch with each request and everything is garbage collected and forgotten after handling the request. I think this is good thing because you don't have to worry whether your tricks with custom.lua, hooks and _CODE changed the FFTempl functionality in some undesired way. If you screw something up, it will be automatically corrected during the next request.","","The speed (all scripts have to be compiled from scratch for each request) also doesn't seem to be a problem even on our old server. However, to lower the system load under critical conditions, you could use luac to pre-compile \"fftempl.lua\" and \"custom.lua\" files (see Lua documentation).",""]},{"action":"insertText","range":{"start":{"row":176,"column":0},"end":{"row":176,"column":261}},"text":"The only drawback is the fact that lack of persistence prohibits you from having for example some global page visit counter.
